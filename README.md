# About this project
A landing page for my client at Kline Account which specialises in user-generated accounts.

***
# **I. Hero**

One of the main attractions for this landing page is the depiction of an Iphone on the SNKRS app showing a successful checkout, the main goal for Kline Accounts.

# **II. Integrations**

Using Kline Account's testimonials, I was able to create a vertical scrolling reviews section which individual cards would fade away when it reaches the top of the box. I have also used Twitter's [Embedded Timeline](https://publish.twitter.com/#) to create a timeline of all Kline Account's tweets for the audience's satisfaction that this company also uses social media to reach out to their clients.

# **III. Animations**

All animations are used from a js library called [AOS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) (animate on scroll) which is both lightweight and beginners friendly.

# **IV. Original UI Mockup**
